# hummel

Hummel is a collection of sane defaults for command line arg parsing, logging, settings configuration
for a node application.

To integrate with a web application use one of the sub-projects, which will pre-wire the application.

"The Hummel was designed in 1942 out of a need for mobile artillery support for the tank forces,
the lack of which had first been felt during the invasion of the USSR."
